Accessibility

What is accessibility?
Can people find it? use it? understand it?

Types of disabilities:
vision - blind, color blind, tunnel vision, hearing,
fine motor and muscle control, learning and cognitive disorders,
seizure and vestibular disorders

12-20% have some disability

AT (assistive technology), use of screen readers, refreshible braille,
magnification, keyboard only input,

Principles:
W3C has principles for making web accessible, standards for HTML, CSS,
Javascript, designed for web devs and designers

WCAG principles, Can i find content, can i use interactive controls,
Can i grasp content, Can I do all this with the platform I want


Level A vs AA. (AA takes into account stuff is happening on the page).
AAA is very strict (nothing moving on the page)

Writing accessible HTML:
Write good valid code, Create content with logical organization,
Add more information to screen readerss

Use paragraphs, headers, use lang="en" since google will know how
to use google translate.

Images = use alt "A cute black and white photo of a kitten."
or use alt "".<figcaption>

Youtube captions.

Tables - use table captions (heading), always use headings,

Form fields - always have form fields

CSS examples:
color contrast, Lea Veron's color contrast tools (gray #999)
(visibility none, hiding)
clip:rect (0 0 0)  (eg.hiding it behind something, or making it so tiny
that you can't see it on the page)
style = display:none

colorrrs

Test with validation test, w3c, verify color contrast,
HTML_codesniffer
wave evaluation tool (chrome add on, gives side bar that gives you
all the errors)

Keyboard accessibility testing
Tab and Sthift tab to move between elements,
Return and enter to fire links
up and down arrows to select radio buttons
spacebar to check a checkbox, fire a button

Screen reader accessibility testing -
Voice over keystrokes
Voice over utility
